# Benchmark

This Shiny app presents the results of benchmarking analyses conducted in the HERON-UK network https://heron-uk.github.io/heron-uk/

These benchmarking results were carried out as part of the onboarding process for data partners joining the HERON-UK network, with the aim of assessing technical readiness and gaining insight into performance across environments.

The analyses evaluate the time performance of R packages designed for working with OMOP CDM data. Specifically, we benchmarked the execution time of selected queries implemented with the following packages:

- [**CDMConnector**](https://darwin-eu.github.io/CDMConnector/)
- [**OmopConstructor**](https://ohdsi.github.io/OmopConstructor/)
- [**CohortConstructor**](https://ohdsi.github.io/CohortConstructor/) 
- [**CodelistGenerator**](https://darwin-eu.github.io/CodelistGenerator/) 
- [**CohortCharacteristics**](https://darwin-eu.github.io/CohortCharacteristics/) 
- [**DrugUtilisation**](https://darwin-eu.github.io/DrugUtilisation/)
- [**IncidencePrevalence**](https://darwin-eu.github.io/IncidencePrevalence/)
